# sameHeight
A jQuery plugin for better alignment of cells in a grid. Plugin looks at children of a container and if they are visually in the same row, it makes them all as tall as the tallest one in the row (using css min-height). This also solves common problem of floated cells in a grid getting stuck after one another due to height difference.
